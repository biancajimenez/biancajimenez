            HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a standard markup language for web page creation. It allows the creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML elements (the building blocks of a web page) such as tags and attributes. 
            </p>
            <p>
            HTML is designed to be both human-readable and machine-readable, making it accessible for developers and browsers alike. With HTML, web developers can define the structure and semantics of web pages, enabling browsers to render content consistently across different devices and platforms. Additionally, HTML works in conjunction with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to enhance the presentation and functionality of web pages, forming the foundation of modern web development.

            
            HTML has a lot of use cases, namely:
            </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Web development -</strong> Developers use HTML code to design how a browser displays web page elements, such as text, hyperlinks, and media files. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Web documentation-</strong> HTML makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Internet navigation -</strong> Users can easily navigate and insert links between related pages and websites as HTML is heavily used to embed hyperlinks. 
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <br>Here are the some of the things I have learned:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Basic structure</strong> of an HTML document: !DOCTYPE, html, head, and body tags.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>HTML elements</strong> such as h1 to h6 for headings, p for paragraphs, a for links, img for images, ul and ol for lists.
            </li>
            <li>
              Examples of <strong>semantic tags</strong> like header, nav, main, section, article, aside, and footer.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Creating forms</strong> form tag and input types like text, email, password, radio buttons, checkboxes, etc. as well as understanding form validation and attributes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Adding images</strong> to web pages using the img tag and attributes like src, alt, width, and height. <strong>Embedding multimedia content</strong> such as videos and audio using video and audio tags.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Creating tables</strong> to display tabular data using table, tr, th, and td tags.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Validating HTML code</strong> using tools like the W3C Markup Validation Service to ensure compliance with HTML standards.
            </li>

          <p>
            CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets language and is used to stylize elements written in a markup language such as HTML. It separates the content from the visual representation of the site. The relation between HTML and CSS is strongly tied together since HTML is the very foundation of a site and CSS is all of the aesthetics of an entire website.
          </p>
          <p>
             With CSS features you donâ€™t need to repeatedly describe how individual elements look. This saves time, shortens the code, and makes it not as prone to errors.
          </p>
          <p>
            CSS lets you stylize everything on a different file, thus creating the design there and later on integrating the CSS files on top of the HTML markup. This makes the actual HTML markup much cleaner and easier to maintain. Nowadays, this is becoming more a necessity than a commodity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here are some of the things I have learned:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Knowledge of <strong>different types of selectors</strong> like element, class, ID, attribute, pseudo-classes, and pseudo-elements.
            </li>
            <li>
              Knowledge of <strong>properties</strong> like width, height, padding, border, and margin.
            </li>
            <li>
              Using <strong>color properties</strong>to set text color, background color, and border color and applying background images, gradients, and patterns to elements.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Positioning elements</strong> using position property values static, relative, absolute, and fixed. Float and clear properties. Utilizing CSS Grid and Flexbox.
            </li>
            <li>
              Customizing <strong>link styles</strong> with properties like text-decoration, color, and hover effects. Designing buttons with background colors, borders, padding, and hover effects
            </li>

          <p>
            JavaScript is a lightweight programming language commonly used by web developers to add dynamic interactions to web pages, applications, servers, and even games. It works seamlessly alongside HTML and CSS, complementing CSS in formatting HTML elements while providing user interaction, a capability that CSS alone lacks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond its role in enhancing HTML and CSS, JavaScript enables the creation of responsive web applications that respond to user input in real-time. Its event-driven nature allows developers to handle user actions such as clicks, scrolls, and keyboard inputs, facilitating the development of engaging interfaces and intuitive user experiences. 
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
            have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have
            to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
            protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
            parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

        <header>Ngrok</header>
        <p> 
          Ngrok is a powerful tool used by developers to create secure tunnels to local servers. It facilitates exposing a local server running on your machine to the public internet. This is particularly useful during web development and testing phases when you need to demonstrate or test your local web application on remote devices or share it with colleagues for feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are the services of ngrok:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Secure Tunneling</strong> - Ngrok establishes a secure tunnel from a public endpoint to a port on your local machine where your server is running.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dynamic DNS</strong> - Ngrok provides a unique URL (usually in the form of a subdomain of ngrok.io) that you can share with others. When someone accesses this URL, Ngrok forwards the traffic through the secure tunnel to your local server.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Inspecting Traffic</strong> - Ngrok provides a web interface where you can inspect incoming requests, see the request/response headers, and debug any issues.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Authentication and Custom Domains</strong> - Ngrok offers features like authentication and the ability to use custom domains for your tunnels, allowing for more secure and branded experiences.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Ngrok is an invaluable tool for developers seeking to bridge the gap between local development environments and the broader internet. It serves as a secure tunneling solution that enables the exposure of locally hosted services to the public web. By establishing a secure connection from a public endpoint provided by Ngrok to a port on the developer's local machine, Ngrok effectively extends the reach of local servers beyond the confines of the developer's environment. This capability proves invaluable during various stages of the development lifecycle, allowing developers to share their work-in-progress with clients, colleagues, or testers for feedback, testing, or demonstration purposes.

        <header>Port Forwarding (NPM)</header>
        <p>
          Port forwarding in the context of npm (Node Package Manager) typically refers to the process of forwarding network traffic from a specific port on your local machine to another port on a remote machine or server. This functionality is commonly used in web development when running local servers that need to be accessible from the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you run a local server using npm (for example, with the npm start command), it typically listens for incoming connections on a specific port, such as port 3000. However, by default, this server is only accessible from your local machine. Port forwarding allows you to expose this local server to the outside world, making it accessible to other devices or users over the internet.
